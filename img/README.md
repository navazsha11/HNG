4\. Regulations and uses\
4\. a Terms of Use Company Network

Non-company computers may not be connected to the company network.\
A connection via VPN (Virtual Private Network) from devices not provided by the company (e.g. the private PC) to the company network is not permitted.

4\. b Terms of use Private devices (smartphone, notebook, home PC, USB)

Company data must not be stored locally on private devices. Synchronisation to Outlook (ActiveSync) may only be set up without saving local data, i.e. for example, Outlook installed locally on the home PC may not download the data of the company Outlook account and save it locally.\
Private devices may only access the internet in the offices via the Guest-Wifi provided separately for this purpose.\
The use of unauthorised data carriers is prohibited (USB).

4\. c Terms of use Private user data

Private user data must not be stored on the company's own computer, as the archiving solution cannot separate private data from company data.\
The user is responsible for the protection and backup of private user data. The same applies to the deletion of data if the company computer is transferred to another user or is taken out of operation.

4\. d Terms of use for e-mails

The Commercial Code prescribes a retention period of 10 years for e-mails with an impact on accounting. All archived e-mails are therefore retained for 10 years.\
E-mails are automatically archived 90 days after they are received or sent.

All archived e-mails are replaced by a shortcut link in the mailbox and can still be accessed in Outlook via this link. After deleting the shortcut link in the mailbox, every user can access his or her archived e-mails and restore them to the Outlook mailbox if required.

A reconstruction of archived e-mails can also be carried out by the IT officer as well as his/her deputy.

Private e-mails must not be processed/stored via the mailboxes of Merantix Momentum GmbH, otherwise private e-mails will also be stored for 10 years.

4\. e Terms of Use Telephone System - Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

Telephone calls are partly transmitted via the internet (VoIP). The software-based VoIP telephone system stores connection logs for e.g. evaluations and improving accessibility. In these protocols, the last four digits of the connection are automatically made unrecognisable for data protection reasons.

If there are disruptions that require the removal of this option, this must be reported to the Data Protection Officer. The cancellation is carried out exclusively by the IT Officer and the person responsible for the telephone communication system. The resulting logs shall only be made accessible to the persons directly involved for the purpose of rectifying the fault, and shall be deleted immediately thereafter. Immediately after the fault has been rectified, the connection data will be re-encrypted.

A personal evaluation of the logs does not take place. The logs are deleted at regular intervals.

4\. f Terms of use of the internet operation

The IT Officer evaluates the log files of the firewalls in order to identify problems - such as hacker attacks, high traffic, etc. - in good time.\
In order to avoid misuse and to better monitor our internet operations, software is also used to block "dubious" or "unique" websites in order to avoid possible employer liability.

Private use of the internet is allowed.\
Access to websites with dubious content is not permitted and will be blocked in case of doubt.\
Private downloads are prohibited.

4\. g Terms of Use Social Networks

The private use of social networks such as Xing, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and/or personal blog sites, etc. is permitted subject to the applicable conditions for Internet use. Business use of the social networks is permitted.

Official information already published by the marketing department may be disseminated independently by employees. Information on developments, projects, customers and employees, as well as financial data, may only be published with the express consent of the management.

Anyone who publishes something on the Internet is responsible for it and should respect the rights of uninvolved third parties, in

particular copyright and personal rights such as privacy and data protection, and comply with existing laws and obligations.

4\. h Terms of Use Mobile IT Resources

For the fulfilment of the official activities, Merantix Momentum GmbH U. provides mobile IT resources, e.g., smartphone, tablet, etc.. The mobile IT resources must be administered in accordance with the requirements of the operating concept provided for this purpose.

The parties agree that the administration is carried out by Merantix Momentum GmbH and that even in the case of a release for private use, the official interest always prevails. The users must in particular prepare themselves for the fact that in the event of loss, damage, or return there is no claim against Merantix Momentum GmbH regarding the surrender of private data. The prevention of the loss of private data must be ensured at the user's own responsibility.

The mobile IT equipment is equipped with a privacy film so that it is difficult for third parties to view personal data.\
Merantix Momentum GmbH shall ensure that separate storage locations are provided on the software side for the separation of private data and business data. This solution must be designed to be at least user-friendly enough to prevent the risk of unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

The synchronization of applications (e.g., WhatsApp, social networks, iCloud, Trello, Slack) on e.g., the calendar or other storage locations of business data must not be technically possible. For this purpose, Merantix Momentum GmbH must take appropriate precautions in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR.

It is recommended that the push messages from various applications are not displayed in plain text (protection through Face ID or similar), as this could potentially interfere with the employee's right to privacy in maintenance cases.

The equipment provided to the individual employee, e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop, must be handled carefully and with care and in accordance with the respective operating instructions. Damage or loss must be reported immediately to IT and Purchasing.

4\. i Clear Desk Policy

The Clear Desk Policy is understood to mean that employees lock all confidential documents located at their workplace. Unauthorized persons (cleaning staff, unauthorized colleagues or visitors) must not have access to them.

When leaving the workplace, all printouts, copies, or the like must be stored in such a way that these documents are inaccessible to third parties (desk, lockable boxes, data media safe).\
Do not leave any printouts in the printer/copier.

Seite 5 von 8

Do not keep password notes at your workplace under any circumstances.\
Lock your computer when you leave your workplace (e.g., under Windows with "Windows key + L"). Unattended, unlocked computers are a high security risk. Unauthorized persons could gain access to confidential data.

5\. Disposal according to DIN 66399

The disposal of hardware and data carriers is carried out by a service provider in accordance with the above-mentioned DIN standard and is confirmed with a corresponding scrapping protocol. There is a corresponding confidentiality agreement with the service provider.

Data Protection Officer: Nils MoÌˆllers, Keyed GmbH, info@keyed.de
